Hello 
this repository contains a trial run for a style guide I created for my school project 
the place  to start should be sampleoutline.html coupled with sampleoutline.css as the style sheet 
this will give a sample overview of the elements with their styles and how they roughlt fit together

Then to get the full list of elements use index2.html, this will provide the list of tables cards and all the design elements needed to make a proper UI
Finally to build on this design use the styleguide.txt with the prefered color pallete to get things going 

This design was made with simplicity in mind to ensure that UI isnt too cluttered so that anyone can use the application with ease even at fitst glance
